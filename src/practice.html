            <p class="evanescence moreReadable typewriter">Evanescence is an American rock band founded in 1995 in Little Rock, by
                Arkansas by singer and musician Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody. After recording independent
                EPs as a duo in the late 90s, and a demo CD, Evanescence released their debut studio album, Fallen,
                on Wind-up Records in 2003. Propelled by the success of hit singles like "Bring Me to Life" and
                "My Immortal", Fallen sold more than four million copies in the US by January 2004, garnering the
                band two Grammy Awards out of six nominations. The band released their first live album and concert
                DVD, Anywhere but Home, in 2004, which sold over one million copies worldwide.

        <p class="spooky">The Open Door is the second studio album by American rock band Evanescence, 
            released on September 25, 2006, by Wind-up Records. Amy Lee had full creative 
            control of the record, incorporating new elements into their previous musical 
            styles, including her classical influences, industrial rock, symphonic metal, 
            progressive rock, electronica and the use of choirs on several songs. The 
            album was written in the course of 18 months, and the recording process was 
            delayed as a result of guitarist Terry Balsamo's stroke. Most of the songs 
            were co-composed by Lee and Balsamo, with production handled by Dave Fortman.

        <p class="noWrap spooky">
            Lee said that she pushed her own limits, doing things she didn't have the courage
             to do in Fallen. She also said her goal was to make a record that she 
             loved even more than Fallen, rather than to copy the formula which made the 
             previous record successful. Lee incorporated her classical influences 
             and new elements in the music, including home-made sounds. When 
             asked whether The Open Door was thematically different from Fallen, Lee 
             said that Evanescence and music in general is her venue to "purge all of the 
             negative and hard, difficult experiences" throughout her life, and while that 
             is front and center in this album, it comes from a less hopeless attitude and 
             with a more reflective outlook. Rather than "wallowing" in "the hard stuff", the 
             record is characterized by her newfound resolution and is thematically in search 
             of answers and happiness.
