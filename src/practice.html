        It's not the <b>books</b> that are dangerous, it's the <strong>ideas</strong> inside of them.</p>

            <p class="evanescence moreReadable typewriter">Evanescence is an American rock band founded in 1995 in Little Rock,<br>
                Arkansas by singer and musician Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody. After recording independent<br>
                EPs as a duo in the late 90s, and a demo CD, Evanescence released their debut studio album, Fallen,<br>
                on Wind-up Records in 2003. Propelled by the success of hit singles like "Bring Me to Life" and<br>
                "My Immortal", Fallen sold more than four million copies in the US by January 2004, garnering the<br>
                band two Grammy Awards out of six nominations. The band released their first live album and concert<br>
                DVD, Anywhere but Home, in 2004, which sold over one million copies worldwide.

        <h4>Fonts</h4>
        <p class="gothic">Both the heading above and this paragraph text are in one of my favourite fonts, 
            Copperplate Gothic. I often use this font on book covers or in situations where I want the text
            to look strong and have a slightly darker feeling.</p>
