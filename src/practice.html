        <p class="moreReadable typewriter">Evanescence is an American rock band founded in 1995 in Little Rock,<br>
            Arkansas by singer and musician Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody. After recording independent<br>
            EPs as a duo in the late 90s, and a demo CD, Evanescence released their debut studio album, Fallen,<br>
            on Wind-up Records in 2003. Propelled by the success of hit singles like "Bring Me to Life" and<br>
            "My Immortal", Fallen sold more than four million copies in the US by January 2004, garnering the<br>
            band two Grammy Awards out of six nominations. The band released their first live album and concert<br>
            DVD, Anywhere but Home, in 2004, which sold over one million copies worldwide.</p>
