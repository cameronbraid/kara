            <p class="evanescence moreReadable typewriter">Evanescence is an American rock band founded in 1995 in Little Rock, by
                Arkansas by singer and musician Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody. After recording independent
                EPs as a duo in the late 90s, and a demo CD, Evanescence released their debut studio album, Fallen,
                on Wind-up Records in 2003. Propelled by the success of hit singles like "Bring Me to Life" and
                "My Immortal", Fallen sold more than four million copies in the US by January 2004, garnering the
                band two Grammy Awards out of six nominations. The band released their first live album and concert
                DVD, Anywhere but Home, in 2004, which sold over one million copies worldwide.

        <p class="gothic">Both the heading above and this paragraph text are in one of my favourite fonts, 
            Copperplate Gothic. I often use this font on book covers or in situations where I want the text
            to look strong and have a slightly darker feeling.</p>
