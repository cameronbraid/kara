            Rain clouds come to play again<br>
            Has no one told you she's not breathing?<br>
            Hello, I'm your mind giving you someone to talk to<br>
            Hello<br><br>
            If I smile and don't believe<br>
            Soon I know I'll wake from this dream<br>
            Don't try to fix me I'm not broken<br>
            Hello, I'm the lie living for you so you can hide<br>
            Don't cry<br><br>
            Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping<br>

            I linger in the doorway<br>
            Of alarm clock screaming<br>
            Monsters calling my name<br>
            Let me stay where the wind will whisper to me<br>
            Where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story<br><br>
            In my field of paper flowers<br>
            And candy clouds of lullaby (Flowers)<br>
            I lie inside myself for hours<br>
            And watch my purple sky fly over me (Flowers)<br><br>
            Don't say I'm out of touch<br>
            With this rampant chaos, your reality<br>
            I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge<br>
            The nightmare I build my own world to escape<br><br>
            In my field of paper flowers<br>
            And candy clouds of lullaby (Flowers)<br>
            I lie inside myself for hours<br>
            And watch my purple sky fly over me (Flowers)<br><br>
            Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming<br>
            Cannot cease for the fear of silent lies<br>
            Oh, how I long for the deep sleep dreaming<br>
            The goddess of imaginary light<br><br>
            In my field of paper flowers<br>
            And candy clouds of lullaby (Flowers)<br>
            I lie inside myself for hours<br>

            <p id="p2">I'm so tired of being here<br>
            Suppressed by all my childish fears<br>
            And if you have to leave<br>
            I wish that you would just leave<br>
            'Cause your presence still lingers here<br>
            And it won't leave me alone<br><br>
            These wounds won't seem to heal<br>
            This pain is just too real<br>
            There's just too much that time cannot erase<br><br>
            When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears<br>
            When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears<br>
            And I held your hand through all of these years<br>
            But you still have all of me<br><br>
            You used to captivate me by your resonating light<br>
            Now I'm bound by the life you left behind<br>
            Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams<br>
            Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me<br><br>
            These wounds won't seem to heal<br>
            This pain is just too real<br>
            There's just too much that time cannot erase<br><br>
            When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears<br>
            When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears<br>
            And I held your hand through all of these years<br>
            But you still have all of me<br><br>
            I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone<br>
            But though you're still with me<br>
            I've been alone all along<br><br>
            When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears<br>
            When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears<br>
            I held your hand through all of these years<br>
            But you still have all of me

            You know I can't stay long<br>
            All I wanted to say was I love you and I'm not afraid<br>
            Oh, can you hear me?<br>
            Can you feel me in your arms?<br><br>
            Holding my last breath<br>
            Safe inside myself<br>
            Are all my thoughts of you<br>
            Sweet raptured light<br>
            It ends here tonight<br><br>
            I'll miss the winter<br>
            A world of fragile things<br>
            Look for me in the white forest<br>
            Hiding in a hollow tree (come find me)<br>
            I know you hear me<br>
            I can taste it in your tears<br><br>

            It ends here tonight<br><br>
            Closing your eyes to disappear<br>
            You pray your dreams will leave you here<br>
            But still you wake and know the truth<br>
            No one's there<br><br>
            Say goodnight<br>
            Don't be afraid<br>
            Calling me<br>
            Calling me as you fade to black<br><br>
            (Say goodnight) Holding my last breath<br>
            (Don't be afraid) Safe inside myself<br>
            (Calling me) Are all my thoughts of you<br>
            Sweet raptured light<br>
            It ends here tonight<br><br>
            (Holding my last breath)<br>
