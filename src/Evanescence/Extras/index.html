                Any sudden movement of my heart<br><br>
                And I know<br>
                I know I'll have to watch them pass away<br>
                Just get through this day<br><br>
                Give up your way<br>
                You could be anything<br>
                Give up my way<br>
                And lose myself<br>
                Not today<br>
                There's too much guilt to pay<br><br>
                Sickened in the sun<br>
                You dare tell me you love me<br>
                But you held me down<br>
                And screamed you wanted me to die<br><br>
                Honey you know<br>
                You know I'd never hurt you that way<br>
                You're just so pretty in your pain<br><br>
                Give up my way<br>
                And I could be anything<br>
                I'll make my own way<br>
                Without your senseless<br>
                Hate, hate, hate, hate<br><br>
                So run, run, run<br>
                And hate me<br>
                If it feels good<br>
                I can't hear your screams anymore<br><br>
                You lied to me<br>
                But I'm older now<br>
                And I'm not buying baby<br>
                Demanding my response<br>
                Don't bother breaking the door down<br>
                I found my way out<br>

                I denied it all so long, oh so long<br>
                Say goodbye, goodbye<br><br>
                My heart is broken<br>
                Release me, I can't hold on<br>
                Deliver us<br><br>
                My heart is broken<br>
                Sweet sleep, my dark angel<br>

            <p id="p2">I'm so tired of being here<br>
            Suppressed by all my childish fears<br>
            And if you have to leave<br>
            I wish that you would just leave<br>
            'Cause your presence still lingers here<br>
            And it won't leave me alone<br><br>
            These wounds won't seem to heal<br>
            This pain is just too real<br>
            There's just too much that time cannot erase<br><br>
            When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears<br>
            When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears<br>
            And I held your hand through all of these years<br>
            But you still have all of me<br><br>
            You used to captivate me by your resonating light<br>
            Now I'm bound by the life you left behind<br>
            Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams<br>
            Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me<br><br>
            These wounds won't seem to heal<br>
            This pain is just too real<br>
            There's just too much that time cannot erase<br><br>
            When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears<br>
            When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears<br>
            And I held your hand through all of these years<br>
            But you still have all of me<br><br>
            I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone<br>
            But though you're still with me<br>
            I've been alone all along<br><br>
            When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears<br>
            When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears<br>
            I held your hand through all of these years<br>

            Oh, can you hear me?<br>
            Can you feel me in your arms?<br><br>

            A world of fragile things<br>
            Look for me in the white forest<br>
            Hiding in a hollow tree (come find me)<br>

            Closing your eyes to disappear<br>
            You pray your dreams will leave you here<br>
            But still you wake and know the truth<br>
            No one's there<br><br>
            Say goodnight<br>
            Don't be afraid<br>
            Calling me<br>
            Calling me as you fade to black<br><br>
            (Say goodnight) Holding my last breath<br>
            (Don't be afraid) Safe inside myself<br>
            (Calling me) Are all my thoughts of you<br>
            Sweet raptured light<br>
            It ends here tonight<br><br>
            (Holding my last breath)<br>

            Always confusing the thoughts in my head<br>
            So I can't trust myself anymore<br><br>
            I'm dying again<br>
            I'm going under (going under)<br>
            Drowning in you (drowning in you)<br>
            I'm falling forever (falling forever)<br>
            I've got to break through<br><br>
            So go on and scream, scream at me<br>
            I'm so far away (so far away)<br>
            I won't be broken again (again)<bR>
            I've got to breathe<br>
            I can't keep going under<Br><br>
            I'm dying again<br>
            I'm going under (going under)<Br>
            Drowning in you (drowning in you)<br>
            I'm falling forever (falling forever)<br>
            I've got to break through<br>
