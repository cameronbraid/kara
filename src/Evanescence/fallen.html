            Oh, how I long for the deep sleep dreaming<br>
            The goddess of imaginary light<br><br>

            Suppressed by all my childish fears<br>
            And if you have to leave<br>
            I wish that you would just leave<br>
            'Cause your presence still lingers here<br>
            And it won't leave me alone<br><br>
            These wounds won't seem to heal<br>
            This pain is just too real<br>
            There's just too much that time cannot erase<br><br>
            When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears<br>
            When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears<br>
            And I held your hand through all of these years<br>
            But you still have all of me<br><br>
            You used to captivate me by your resonating light<br>
            Now I'm bound by the life you left behind<br>
            Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams<br>
            Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me<br><br>
            These wounds won't seem to heal<br>

            I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone<br>
            But though you're still with me<br>
            I've been alone all along<br><br>
            When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears<br>
