            <p id="1p">You would not believe your eyes<br>
            If ten million fireflies<br>
            Lit up the world as I fell asleep<br>
            'Cause they'd fill the open air<br>
            And leave teardrops everywhere<br>
            You'd think me rude but<br>
            I'd just stand and stare<br><br>
            I'd like to make myself believe<br>
            That planet Earth turns slowly<br>
            It's hard to say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep<br>
            'Cause everything is never as it seems<br><br>
            I'd get a thousand hugs<br>
            From ten thousand lightning bugs<br>
            As they tried to teach me how to dance<br>
            A foxtrot above my head<br>
            A sock hop beneath my bed<br>
            A discon ball is just hanging by a thread.<br><br>
            I'd like to make myself believe<br>
            That planet Earth turns slowly<br>
            It's hard to say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep<br>
            'Cause everything is never as it seems<br><br>
            Leave my door open just a crack (Please take me away from here)<br>
            'Cause I feel like such an insomniac (Please take me away from here)<br>
            Why do I tire of counting sheep (Please take me away from here)<br>
            When I'm far too tired to fall asleep.<br><br>
            To ten million fireflies<br>
            I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes<br>
            I've got misty eyes as they say farewell<br>
            But I'll know where several are<br>
            If my dreams get real bizzare<br>
            'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar<br><br>
            I'd like to make myself believe<br>
            That planet Earth turns slowly<br>
            It's hard to say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep<br>
            'Cause everything is never as it seems<br><br>I'd like to make myself believe<br>
            That planet Earth turns slowly<br>
            It's hard to say I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep<br>
            Because my dreams are bursting at the seams.<br><br>

            <p id="p2">Ship wreck in a sea of faces<br>
            It's a dreamy world up there<br>
            Dear friends in higher places<br>
            Carry me away from here<br><br>
            Travel light let the sun eclipse you<br>
            'Cause your flight is about to leave<br>
            And there's more to this grand adventure<br>
            Then you'd ever believe<br><br>
            Bird's eye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you.<br>
            Wide eyes will always brighten the blue.<br>
            Chase your dreams, and remember me sweet bravery<br>
            'Cause, after all, those dreams will take you up so high<br>
            So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind<br>
            And take to the sky<br>
            (You take to the sky)<br><br>
            On the hills of war and wonder<br>
            There's a stormy world up there<br>
            You can't whisper above the thunder<br>
            But you can fly anywhere<br><br>
            A purple burst of paper birds<br>
            This picture paints a thousand words<br>
            So take a breath of myth and mystery<br>
            And don't look back.<br><br>
            Bird's eye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you.<br>
            Wide eyes will always brighten the blue.<br>
            Chase your dreams, and remember me sweet bravery<br>
            'Cause, after all, those dreams will take you up so high<br>
            So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind<br>
            And take to the sky<br>
            (You take to the sky)<br><br>
            There's a realm above the trees<br>
            Where the lost are finally found<br>
            So touch your feathers to the breeze<br>
            And leave the ground<br><br>
            Bird's eye view, awake the stars 'cause they're all around you.<br>
            Wide eyes will always brighten the blue.<br>
            Chase your dreams, and remember me sweet bravery<br>
            'Cause, after all, those dreams will take you up so high<br>
            So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind<br>
            And take to the sky<br>
            (You take to the sky)<br><br>

            <br><br><h2 id="3" class="main">The Real World</h2><br>
            <p id="p2">I saw the autumn leaves<br>
            Peal up off the street,<br>
            Take wing on the balmy breeze<br>
            And sweep you off your feet.<br>
            And you blushed as they scooped you up,<br>
            On sugar maple wings<br>
            To gaze down on the city below<br>
            Ablaze with wonderous things.<br><br>
            Tell me feathers kiss your face<br>
            And flutter everywhere<br>
            Reality is a lovely place<br>
            But I wouldn't want to live there.<br><br>
            Weighed down by heavy lids<br>
            And lunar lullabies<br>
            I knew you were wide awake<br>
            'Cause you smile with your eyes<br><br>
            Tell me feathers kiss you face<br>
            And flutter everywhere.<br>
            Reality is a lovely place,<br>
            But I wouldn't want to live there.<br><br>
            From the green belt balcony,<br>
            Wildfires look so pretty<br>
            Ponderosa canopy<br>
            I'd never leave if it were up to me<br><br>
            To the ruby redwood tree<br>
            And the velvet climbing ivy<br>
            Painted all mahogany<br>
            I'd never leave if it were up to me.<br><br>
            If it were up to me.<br><br>
            Can you feel the silk embrace<br>
            In the satin air.<br>
            If we dissolve with out a trace<br>
            Would the real world even care<br><br>
            Tell me feathers kiss your face<br>
            And flutter everywhere<br>
            Reality is a lovely place<br>
            But I wouldn't want to live there.<br><br>
            I saw the autumn leaves<br>
            Peal up off the street<br>
            Take wing on the balmy breeze<br>
            And sweep you off your feet.<br>

            <br><br><h2 id="4" class="main">Angels</h2><br>
            <p id="p2">Through the glass in my bedroom window,<br>
            In the bushes far below,<br>
            I thought I saw an unfamiliar shadow,<br>
            Among the ones I so clearly know<br><br>
            I’ve been sleeping with the night light unplugged,<br>
            With a note on the rocking chair<br>
            That says I’m dreaming of the life I once loved,<br>
            So wake me if you’re out there.<br><br>
            Living close to the ground,<br>
            It’s seventh heaven ‘cause there are angels all around<br>
            Among my frivolous thoughts,<br>
            I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts.<br>
            (So wake me if you’re out there)<br><br>
            (Wake me if you’re out there)<br><br>
            In the dust on my cellar staircase,<br>
            A pair of footprints followed me,<br>
            I saw a flicker in the fake fireplace,<br>
            Blinked again but there was nothing to see.<br><br>
            I’ve been leaving all the windows unlocked,<br>
            With a basket by the oak tree,<br>
            ‘Cause I’ll be picking up the acorns that fall off<br>
            If you’ll be climbing up to meet me.<br><br>
            Living close to the ground,<br>
            It’s seventh heaven ‘cause there are angels all around<br>
            Among my frivolous thoughts,<br>
            I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts.<br>
            (So wake me if you’re out there)<br><br>
            I keep my knees black and blue ‘cause they often hit the hard wood floor<br>
            And I believe, so I’m not praying to the ceiling anymore.<br><br>
            I’ve been sleeping with the night light unplugged,<br>
            With a note on the rocking chair<br>
            That says I’m dreaming of the life I once loved,<br>
            So wake me if you’re out there.<br><br>
            Living close to the ground,<br>
            It’s seventh heaven ‘cause there are angels all around<br>
            Among my frivolous thoughts,<br>
            I believe there are beautiful things seen by the astronauts.<br><br>
            The indications reveal<br>
            That few of us realise life is quite surreal<br>
            So if you’re dying to see,<br>
            I guarantee there are angels around your vicinity.<br><br>
            So if you’re dying to see,<br>
            I guarantee there are angles around your vicinity.

            <p id="p2">Splash down in the silver screen,<br>
            Into a deep dramatic scene,<br>
            I swim through the theatre,<br>
            Or maybe I’m just a dreamer.<br><br>
            Like a kite in the bright midday,<br>
            Wonder stole my breath away,<br>
            Shy sonata from Mercury,<br>
            The stars always sing so pretty.<br><br>
            This picnic will soon depart,<br>
            Real life, I’m sad to see you go,<br>
            I’ll miss you with all my heart,<br>
            But I’d rather be alone.<br><br>
            ‘Cause I couldn’t live without<br>
            Sunsets that dazzle in the dusk<br>
            So I’ll drag the anchor up, and rest assured<br>
            ‘Cause dreams don’t turn to dust.<br>
            Dreams don't turn to dust.<br><br>
            I made through the countryside,<br>
            And my eyes never grew so wide,<br>
            Apple, raspberry, river blue,<br>
            I don’t want to leave without you.<br><br>
            In the sound I’ll gladly drown,<br>
            Into the emerald underground.<br>
            I rub my eyes ’cause it’s hard to see,<br>
            Surrounded by all this beauty.<br><br>
            This picnic will soon depart,<br>
            Real life, I’m sad to see you go,<br>

            (I’m sad to see you go, <br>
            But I’d rather be alone)<br><br>
            When tiger eyes begin making you blush,<br>
            When diamonds boast they can’t be crushed.<br>
            Let ‘em go, ‘cause dreams don’t turn to dust.<br><br>
