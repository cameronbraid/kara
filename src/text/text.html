            <p id="1p">To anyone who didn’t know better, Riley 
                Miller was a perfectly ordinary fourteen-year-old boy. 
                He was tall and thin with startling green eyes that peered 
                from beneath a forelock of thick black hair. He was a 
                quiet boy, someone who preferred to hang about at the back 
                of a group and who hated being the centre of attention. He 
                had no particular friends at school and liked it that way.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                But in truth, Riley was the opposite of ordinary. Since the 
                age of three, when his parents had been killed in a house fire, 
                he had lived with his draconian uncle, a man who hated him and 
                didn’t bother to hide it. In an effort to find excuses to stay 
                out of the house, Riley took up martial arts lessons, attending 
                three times a week, and he spent all his other afternoons taking 
                extra language lessons – something he had found he enjoyed very 
                much. This is why, by the age of fourteen, Riley Miller was 
                fluent in five languages (Italian, Spanish, German, French and 
                Russian) and was a second Dan black belt in Taekwondo.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                As Riley walked to school one Tuesday morning, he was deep in 
                thought about that day’s chemistry class. Chemistry was his second 
                favourite subject, after languages. He loved learning what elements 
                substances were made of, and how they reacted together. This term 
                his class had be learning about dangerous household chemicals, and 
                Riley couldn’t believe how any of them were legal.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Lost in his thoughts, Riley ran straight into a brick wall. At 
                least, he thought it was a brick wall until he looked up. A 
                scowling, burly policeman was blocking his way.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <em>Burly is an understatement,</em> Riley thought, <em>This guy’s 
                a man-mountain!</em>
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                “Sorry!” Riley said, embarrassed – and slightly nervous. He tried 
                to duck around the policeman’s muscled torso, but an arm like a 
                tree trunk swung out and a hand the size of a dinner plate 
                landed on his shoulder. 
                </p>

            <p id="p2">The sun fought through the clouds and struggled in vain 
                to pierce the thick forest canopy. Below, the raindrops slid off 
                leaves and plummeted to the ground where a pack of dogs lie. On 
                the outskirts of the pack, dogs sit sentry, watching between the 
                trees for movement. The forest is a dangerous place, especially at 
                night.</p>
