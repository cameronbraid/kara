                <summary>Lyrics for <em>Breathe in Now</em></summary>
                <p>I see love and beauty all around<br>
                I also see the sadness thats embedded in your frown<br>
                I wonder why you choose not to talk to those who surround<br>
                I sense a fear of lifting heavy feet<br>
                Higher than you want to, I just want to believe your truth..<br><br>
                You stand there but you do not cast a shadow<br>
                You walk away with every word you choose not to say<br>
                I suppose that moving on paints a new colour for each day<br>
                I dont like to see dreams put on the shelf<br>
                To deal with on that one day<br>
                I just want to be happy for you<br><br>
                Cause I only have one second, this minute today<br>
                Can't press rewind and turn it back and call it now<br>
                And so this moment I just have to sing out loud<br>
                And say I love I like and breathe in now<br>
                And say I love I live and breathe in now<br><br>
                I move on holding on to what I learn<br>
                It's time to let go of the notion<br>
                That the whole world's against me<br>
                Break free of shackles that formed young<br>
                Time free in now and now I know<br>
                Its not all up to me, I can count on another<br>
                So move on lighter and be free<br><br>
                Cause I only have one second, this minute today<br>
                Can't press rewind and turn it back and call it now<br>
                And so this moment I just have to sing out loud<br>
                I say I love I like and breathe in now<br>
                And say I love I live and breathe in<br>
                I beleive in for today I just want to know that you're okay<br>
                Cause I beleive in breathing just for today<br>
                I just want to know that you're okay</p>

                <summary>Lyrics for <em>Special Ones</em></summary>
                <p>Isn't it funny how you never really screamed at my face<br>
                But your anger so unspoken and unchannelled<br>
                Permeates my essence to the point where<br>
                I don't want to see you, hear you<br>
                Be anywhere near you<br><br>
                You probably think I'm threatened by you<br>
                But your illusionary power doesn't threaten me<br>
                Actually, I think it's kind of funny<br>
                That you create an illusion that is a mirror<br>
                I don't appreciate you and I know that that surprises you<br>
                I suppose you see that those who follow their heart always win<br>
                Those with integrity have won the match before it's begun<br><br>
                So rather than being kicked around<br>
                I'm going to kick you to the curb<br>
                So rather than being pushed around<br>
                I'm going to push you away first<br>
                So rather than trying to protect you<br>
                I'm going to cover my bases first<br>
                So rather than trying to open my heart<br>
                I'm going to lock it with a key<br>
                So that only the special ones<br>
                So that only the special ones<br>
                Can ever get through to me<br><br>
                Some can see beyond the barrier of threshold<br>
                Whereas others can't see beyond their sculptured mold<br>
                You could offer me nothing<br>
                You could offer me nothing that I need<br>
                Do you think I'm asking too much?<br>
                A kind of respect and trust that shouldn't even be questioned<br>
                How can I open my heart with dishonesty sitting next to me?<br>
                I've honoured your honour to the point of embarrassment<br>
                But innocence in the hands of the guilt-free is kicked to, is kicked to the curb<br>
                I was ashamed of my innocence, I was ashamed of my innocence<br>
                But now with clarity, I see that your bullshit is just not worthy of me<br><br>
                So rather than being kicked around<br>
                I'm going to kick you to the curb<br>
                So rather than being pushed around<br>
                I'm going to push you away first<br>
                So rather than trying to protect you<br>
                I'm going to cover my bases first<br>
                So rather than trying to open my heart<br>
                I'm going to lock it with a key<br>
                So that only the special ones<br>
                So that only the special ones<br>
                Can ever get through to me<br><br>
                I don't want to be angry...<br>
                This is not worthy of me and now with clarity<br>
                I see that I can walk away, I can walk away<br>

                <p>I can't help waiting deliberating<br>
                Depths of age pale away<br>
                And I am trying to rediscover<br>
                The wide-eyed beauty of the first glance<br><br>
                And you can take what's mine<br>
                Add to the weight of time<br>
                With cold eyes and a furrowed brow<br>
                And you can take what's mine<br>
                Turn back the hands of time<br>
                But for young, time is the sun<br><br>
                From where does fear spawn<br>
                From the older ingrained scorn<br>
                Does it mean that my mind won't cry<br>
                And I can't believe that you're happy to bleed<br>
                From your cold eyes<br><br>
                Each year I peel back my skin<br>
                And fleshy pink appears<br>
                Yet a harder layer grows<br>
                To protect my uncertainty<br>
                Young grow fear to love<br>
                Resist my resistance<br>
                Reluctance to return a smile<br><br>
                From where does fear spawn<br>
                From the older ingrained scorn<br>
                Does it mean that my mind won't cry<br>
                And I can't believe that you're happy to bleed<br>
                From your cold eyes</p>

                <p>Work through joy through work<br>
                The goddess of religion dogma and guilt<br>
                Poor me, start joyful destiny, respite, guilt-free passion<br>
                Grant fear of freedom, sympathy, God and myself, God and myself<br>
                To another place from respect, joyful girl, thank you<br><br>
                And I'm ready to release on another day<br>
                I'm ready to respect the day today<br>
                I'm ready to respect myself today<br>
                I'm ready to release<br><br>
                Self-image confidence troubled, comfortable blame, touching<br>
                Partake with grace, jealousy, wisdom, unabashed joy and me, you, yum<br>
                Power transference to equality, letting go joy again<br>
                Loving do unto others as to yourself, thank you<br><br>
                And I'm ready to release on another day<br>
                I'm ready to respect the day today<br>
                I'm ready to respect myself today<br>
                I'm ready to release on another day<br>
                I'm ready to respect myself today<br>
                I'm ready to releaseb<br><br>
                Male, female, innocent carefree, fate, honour and wrong<br>
                Success caressing a self-love, do to yourself as to others<br>
                Comfortable held release, comfortable held release...<br><br>
                And I'm ready to release on another day<br>
                I'm ready to respect the day today<br>
                I'm ready to respect myself today<br>
                I'm ready to release on another day<br>
                I'm ready to release myself today<br>
                I'm ready to release<br><br>

                <summary>Lyrics for <em>Truth</em></summary>
                <p>She always said it was difficult to be jealous<br>
                Of something that wasn't really there<br>
                I thought I knew love<br>
                But I was simply trying to convince myself of it<br>
                Trying to justify and prove myself<br><br>
                Finding your own love of yourself<br>
                And sharing it with another love<br>
                Your truth sears through me like a giddy rush<br>
                But like a too sharp knife as well It's hurting me<br>
                It's not so scary, it is liberating, it is truth<br><br>
                I see your truth and you see mine<br>
                We shock ourselves with the imagery<br>
                Only cause I hold up the mirror<br>
                And I show you me and you show me yourself<br><br>
                CHORUS<br>
                I think it's called truth<br>
                I know that it's right<br>
                In all it's splendid beauty and vivid gain<br>
                I think it's called truth<br>
                I think it deserves to bring beautiful glory with necessary pain<br><br>
                You do not make me feel complete<br>
                Just part of another whole that halved<br>
                Is another wonderful self<br>
                Joined in a beautiful mystery journey<br>
                A snake finding legs<br>
                And a horse learning to sit a while<br>
                Making mistakes along the way<br>
                And hurting another is par for the course<br>
                If you are following your own<br>
                Which of course you need to do<br>
                As broken wings are mended<br>
                And we watch us fly<br><br>
                I see your truth and you see mine<br>
                We shock ourselves with the imagery<br>
                Only cause I hold up the mirror<br>
                And you show me and I show you myself<br><br>
                CHORUS</p>
